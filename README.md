Tired of manually adding upstream remotes from GitHub and BitBucket? 
Then `clone` is for you.
`clone` is a Python 3 script which can clone any Mercurial or Git repo.
If the repo is a fork on GitHub or BitBucket, Beatiful Soup 3 will be 
used to parse the URL for upstream repo and add it to your clone as a
remote called (surprise!) `upstream`.
